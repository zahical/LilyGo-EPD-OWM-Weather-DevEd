These are the source PNGs for most of the images used by the UI drawing code.

They are used by first converting them to C arrays with the help of the [gen.sh](../scripts/gen.sh) script (and the [fontconvert.py](../scripts/fontconvert.py)) tool.

Also, it contains some raw artwork files in [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) format.

The AirTree, TFL, THi and TLo images are based on (MIT-licensed) icons from the [iconoir project](https://iconoir.com/), (Optical Size: 21; Stroke Weight 1.5).
